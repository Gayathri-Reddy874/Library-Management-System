📚 C Library Management System

A simple, yet robust Library Management System (LMS) built entirely in C programming language ⚡.
This console-based application demonstrates foundational C skills like file handling, modular programming, and direct console manipulation.

🚀 A testament to building a functional system from scratch using only the C standard library.

✨ Core Functionality

🔹 📖 Book & Data Management

Add ➕, View 👀, Edit ✏️, and Delete ❌ book records.

Data persistence with binary file storage (Record.dat).

Demonstrates efficient binary file I/O.

🔹 🔐 User Authentication

Simple login system 🔑.

Password stored securely in password.dat.

Introduces basic security & authentication concepts.

🔹 🔎 Search & Retrieval

Search books by ID 🆔 or Name 📝.

Implements sequential search logic.

🔹 🖥️ Console UI

Uses Windows-specific functions:

gotoxy()

SetConsoleCursorPosition()

Creates a structured, interactive text-based UI 🎨.

🔹 📂 Modular Design

Organized into multiple header & source files:

general_functions.h

core_functions.h

Clean, maintainable, and professional project structure.

🌟 Project Highlights

✅ Built without external libraries → pure C standard library only.
✅ Solidifies structures, pointers, file handling, modularity.
✅ Great learning resource for students & beginner developers.
✅ Showcases how to design a real-world functional application in C.
